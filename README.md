    Uses JavaScript to create a simple game for guessing a secret phrase.
    Uses CSS to create fun animations that also improve the user experience.

## CSS extra styles and animations:
- a fadein animation was added to the modal box content;
- a name pop-up animation was added to the modal window in the person name;
- a hover effect on each card was also added bringing a light blue background and a shiny box-shadow;
- an extra hegit style was added to the mondal window img to avoid content layout shift;

### Additional info:
This project is the fifth part of a Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Therefore, my personal work is in the js folder, plus the extra.css file (within the css folder). The other styles and the markup were provided.
