# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 05
    Public API Requests
    Uses JavaScript to fetch data from an API and display to the user
    Uses CSS to create animations and ad styles to improve the user experience.

## CSS extra styles and animations:
- a fadein animation was added to the modal box content;
- a name pop-up animation was added to the modal window in the person name;
- a hover effect on each card was also added bringing a light blue background and a shiny box-shadow;
- an extra hegit style was added to the mondal window img to avoid content layout shift;

### Additional info:
This project is the fifth part of a Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Therefore, my personal work is in the js folder, plus the extra.css file (within the css folder). The other styles and the markup were provided.
